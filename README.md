# TPMS Geely Coolray (SX11) hack

This esphome project generates a radio signal that simulates tire pressure sensors.

Using a web interface, sensor id, pressure and temperature values ​​can be set. You can see signals from sensors in the logger. If you want to know the sensor number, you can deflate a tire, and it will start transmitting signals that can be seen in the logs.

## Hardware:
ESPHome supported microcontrollers and Lora transceiver.
I use ESP32 S2 Mini board and Ra-02 module.
